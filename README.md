# AI-Cube
I will create an AI that will solve any rubik's cube
Cube Features

    You may generate a cube with as many cubie objects as you want. (I would not reccomend surpassing a size of 50 as it will start to lag)
    You may shuffle the cube for x amount of steps.
    You may play all the moves that has been made backwards.
    You may manually select an index, and rotate around an axis clockwise or counter-clockwise.

Project information
Current project version: Unity 2018.3.8f1
It should work fine to use other versions. But you will have to wait for the project to update the first time. Any version of Unity that is version 2018.3 and newer should work for this project without issues!
